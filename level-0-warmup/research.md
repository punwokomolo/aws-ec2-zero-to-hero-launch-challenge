**3 scenarios where you'd use EC2**

1. **Hosting a scalable web application**: Deploying websites or APIs that need to handle variable traffic by automatically scaling resources up or down.
2. **Running batch processing jobs**: Performing data analysis, video rendering, or scientific simulations that require temporary compute power.
3. **Development and testing environments**: Creating isolated, on-demand environments for software development, testing, or staging before production deployment.


- **EC2**: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to run virtual servers as needed.
- **AMI**: An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template that contains the operating system and software required to launch an EC2 instance.
- **Instance Type**: Instance types define the hardware specifications (CPU, memory, storage, and networking) for EC2 instances, tailored for different workloads.
- **Key Pair**: A key pair consists of a public and private key used to securely access EC2 instances via SSH.
- **Security Group**: A security group acts as a virtual firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.
