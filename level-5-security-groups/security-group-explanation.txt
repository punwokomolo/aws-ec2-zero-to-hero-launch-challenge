What are Security Groups?
Line 1: ______this are groups that decide how to enter ,leave and how to use the server _________________________________________
Line 2: ____virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources, mainly EC2 instances.___________________________________________

What I learned from the experiment:

When I removed the HTTP (port 80) rule, the website stopped loading because inbound web traffic was blocked.
After adding the HTTP rule back, the website loaded again, showing that security groups control access to resources.
